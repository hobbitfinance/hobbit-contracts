**Burning Mechanism**

We have implemented a perpetual burning mechanism that serves as a mechanism to ensure that HOBBIT is kept consistently high \(inherited from Goose Finance\). In particular:

* A 5% burn fee will be charged at staking;
* 80% of the burn fee will be used to buyback HOBBIT and burn it;
* 10% will be sent to the developerâ€™s address;
* 10% will be held in escrow for Hobbit Finance, for future projects;

**Betting Mechanism**

We aim to implement a betting system for sport and e-sport field. We will launch some bets based on popular betting websites.

* Everyone can attend by HOBBIT Token.
* A Winner will take 85% prize, 15% for burning token;

**Security**

* Timelock added to the contract at launch.
* Removed migrator code \(inherited from Pancake swap\).
